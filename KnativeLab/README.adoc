= Knative Serving Configuration

This lab focuses on the configuration of Knative Serving for OpenLibertyApplication instances. Before proceeding with this lab, it is advisable to complete the AutoscalingLab.

== Knative Serving
`Knative Serving` simplifies the deployment of serverless applications by abstracting away infrastructure complexities. With serverless computing, users can deploy their applications without the burden of managing the underlying servers. The platform dynamically allocates machine resources as per demand, alleviating users from the worries of capacity planning, configuration, maintenance, and container scaling.

One of the key benefits of Knative Serving is its automatic scaling feature, which efficiently adjusts resource allocation based on workload demands. It also provides robust routing and network programming capabilities, enabling intelligent traffic distribution. Additionally, it provides support for point-in-time snapshots, allowing users to capture and manage previous versions of deployed code and configurations. This provides a safety net for seamless rollbacks and helps testing and version control for better application stability.

== Getting Started
* Using educational cluster? If you need access to the cluster, please contact Lab Administrators to have credentials assigned to you.
* Using your own cluster? Please follow link:++../Prerequisites.adoc++[Prerequisites guide] before proceeding.

== Deployment Options
Choose one of two methods to deploy OpenLibertyApplication instance on your cluster.

.*Method A: Deployment through `oc` client*
// [%collapsible]
// ====
1. Make sure you have `oc` client and `jq` installed in your system. `oc` client is used to communicate with RedHat OpenShift cluster and `jq` is a JSON processing tool, which helps formatting and extracting data.

2. Log into a RedHat OpenShift cluster.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc login --server=https://<cluster-api-ip-address>:6443 --username=<username> --password=<password>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc login --server=https://9.123.456.789:6443 --username=testuser --password=PasswordExample123
----
+
If you do not have access to a cluster, please contact Lab Administrators to have credentials assigned to you.


2. To set your current namespace to be the namespace you will be working in, run the following commands:
+
NOTE: _Replace `<your-namespace>` with the namespace provided to you for the lab._
+
[source,sh]
----
export NAMESPACE=<your-namespace>
oc project $NAMESPACE
----

3. Ensure `Red Hat OpenShift Serverless` operator is installed on the cluster and Knative Serving instance is Ready.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get subscription serverless-operator -n openshift-serverless
oc get KnativeServing knative-serving -n knative-serving
----
+
You will get similar to the following if the operator is installed and the instance is Ready:
+
[source,log]
----
NAME                  PACKAGE               SOURCE             CHANNEL
serverless-operator   serverless-operator   redhat-operators   stable
NAME              VERSION   READY   REASON
knative-serving   1.9       True  
----
+
If you do not see any of the two outputs correctly, contact Lab Administrators.

4. Create a YAML file called `knative-enabled-sample.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: knative-enabled-sample
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started@sha256:e22dd56a05e44618a10d275d3ff07a38eb364c0f04f86ffe9618d83dd5467860
  replicas: 1
  createKnativeService: true
  expose: true
  service:
    port: 9080
    type: ClusterIP
----

5. Create the OpenLibertyApplication instance using the command:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc apply -f knative-enabled-sample.yaml
----
+
The operator will create a Knative Service resource which manages the entire life cycle of a workload.

6. Check the status of the OpenLibertyApplication instance by running:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get OpenLibertyApplication knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE -ojson | jq '.status.conditions'
----
It will print output similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-10-25T18:38:23Z",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Reconciled"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-10-25T18:38:23Z",
    "message": "Knative service is ready.",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ResourcesReady"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-10-25T18:38:23Z",
    "message": "Application is reconciled and resources are ready.",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Ready"
  }
]
----
+
As in the example output, `status` field shows that Knative service is ready instead of reporting the number of application replicas. If the `status` reports that the Application is not ready, check the pod's log.

7. Check the managed resources and their statuses. Run the command: 
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get all -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
Then the output will be similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----

----
+
It shows Deployment and its associated Pods, Services, Route and Knative resources created by the operator. Two containers are running for the Pod: one for Liberty application and one for Queue proxy, which is a sidecar container serving as a reverse proxy in front of the Liberty application.
+
Knative service autoscales the workload and when the workload is idle, it may scale the pod to zero. Then the pod will not be included in the output. When traffic is observed, the pod will be scaled back up.

8. Get the URL allocated by `route.serving.knative.dev/knative-enabled-sample`. For example: `https://knative-enabled-sample-liberty-lab.apps.operators.cp.fyre.ibm.com`.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get route.serving.knative.dev/knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
[source,log]
----
NAME                     URL                                                                                    READY   REASON
knative-enabled-sample   https://knative-enabled-sample-test-namespace.apps.liberty-operator.cp.fyre.ibm.com   True    
----
+
Access the page, and you will be able to see the sample Liberty app page with Open Liberty 23.0.0.3. You may experience some delays if Knative scaled the pod to zero to recreate and rerun the service.
+
image:images/sample-app-page.png[,800]

9. Let's take a closer look at the Knative service instance. Run below to get the revision details:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get rev -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
[source,log]
----
NAME                           CONFIG NAME              K8S SERVICE NAME   GENERATION   READY   REASON   ACTUAL REPLICAS   DESIRED REPLICAS
knative-enabled-sample-00001   knative-enabled-sample                      1            True             1                 1
----
+
You will see that the revision's generation is 1. This captures point-in-time snapshot of the Knative service. The actual and desired replicas in the output may be 0's because of Knative service's scale-to-zero feature when the pod is idle.

10. Edit OpenLibertyApplication to update application image. Edit `applicationImage` field under `spec` field:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc edit OpenLibertyApplication knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started@sha256:f7c7da21059eef8734cf0d43a417609aecf68bfe89d0be8e61012fade5877a01
----
+
Wait until the application pod is ready. You can check if the pod is ready through running the following:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get pods -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----

11. Access the sample app on browser again to update the pod. You will see that the version is updated to Open Liberty 23.0.0.8 from 23.0.0.3.
+
image:images/sample-app-page-new.png[,800]
+
Run the command:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get rev -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
[source,log]
----
NAME                           CONFIG NAME              K8S SERVICE NAME   GENERATION   READY   REASON   ACTUAL REPLICAS   DESIRED REPLICAS
knative-enabled-sample-00001   knative-enabled-sample                      1            True             0                 0
knative-enabled-sample-00002   knative-enabled-sample                      2            True             1                 1
----
+
You can now see 2 revision outputs. Notice `knative-enabled-sample-00002` instance's generation value is 2 and the replicas are running under that revision.

12. You can rollback to the previous revision, distribute traffic to both revisions and also rollout to the latest revision. Edit Knative service to use both revisions.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc edit ksvc knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
Edit `traffic` field under `spec` field:
+
[source,log]
----
  traffic:
  - latestRevision: false
    percent: 50
    revisionName: knative-enabled-sample-00001
  - latestRevision: false
    percent: 50
    revisionName: knative-enabled-sample-00002
----
+
This will route 50% of traffic to the first revision and the other 50% to the latest revision.

13. Access the sample app on browser again and try refreshing the page several times. It will change the Open Liberty version from time to time. This ensures 50% of the traffic is assigned to the first revision (23.0.0.3) and the other to the second revision (23.0.0.8).

14. Edit OpenLibertyApplication to disable Knative configuration. Locate `createKnativeService` field under `spec` field and change its value to false:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc edit OpenLibertyApplication knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
...
  createKnativeService: false
...
----

15. When you check the managed resources, you will see that Knative managed resources are deleted and new Deployment, Service and Route resources are created.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get all -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=knative-enabled-sample -n $NAMESPACE
----
+
Then the output will be similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE

----

16. Check the status of the OpenLibertyApplication instance by running:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get OpenLibertyApplication knative-enabled-sample -ojson -n $NAMESPACE | jq '.status.conditions'
----
+
Then the output will be similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-10-25T19:00:58Z",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Reconciled"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-10-25T19:01:00Z",
    "message": "Deployment replicas ready: 1/1",
    "reason": "MinimumReplicasAvailable",

    "message": "Application is reconciled and resources are ready.",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Ready"
  }
]
----
+
Now the OpenLibertyApplication instance is reporting that the application is hosted as a Deployment with static replica of 1.

// ====


.*Method B: Deployment through OpenShift Web Console*
// [%collapsible]
// ====

1. Access your OpenShift web console. Web console's URL starts with https://console-openshift-console.apps.

2. Switch to the Developer perspective, if it is set to the Administrator perspective. Ensure you are on a project/namespace that you were assigned with for the lab.
+
image:images/perspective.png[,500]

3. Click `+Add`. Under `Developer Catalog`, click `Operator Backed`. This page shows the operator catalog on the cluster and enables you to deploy operator managed services.
+
image:images/operator-backed.png[,500]
+
Make sure you see *Knative Serving* in the list. If not, please contact Lab Administrator to have it installed.
+
image:images/operator-backed-knative.png[,800]

4. Click OpenLibertyApplication and create an instance.
+
image:images/create-instance.png[,800]
+
Select YAML view and copy the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: knative-enabled-sample
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started@sha256:e22dd56a05e44618a10d275d3ff07a38eb364c0f04f86ffe9618d83dd5467860
  replicas: 1
  createKnativeService: true
  expose: true
  service:
    port: 9080
    type: ClusterIP
----
+
The operator will create a Knative Service resource which manages the entire life cycle of a workload.

5. You will see that an instance is created in `Topology` tab. Select `KSVC knative-enabled-sample` below the icon. You can select a resource that you would like to investigate.
+
image:images/topology.png[,900]
+
It shows Knative service's Pod, Revision and Route created by the operator. Two containers are running for the Pod: one for Liberty application and one for Queue proxy, which is a sidecar container serving as a reverse proxy in front of the Liberty application. Knative service autoscales the workload and when the workload is idle, so it may scale the pod to zero. Then the pod will be removed in the list. When traffic is observed (i.e. route is accessed), the pod will be scaled back up.

6. You will see that there is only 1 revision. This captures point-in-time snapshot of the Knative service. Note that the replicas may be 0’s. This is an example of Knative service’s scale-to-zero feature when the pod is idle.
+
image:images/revisions.png[,900]

7. Get the URL allocated by `Routes` resource. You can locate it under `Routes` section on the right. For example: `https://knative-enabled-sample-test-namespace.apps.was-education-cluster.cp.fyre.ibm.com`.
+
image:images/route.png[,900]
+
Access the page, and you will be able to see the sample Liberty app page with Open Liberty 23.0.0.3. It may take some time to load the page and it is due to autoscaling back up from 0 replica.
+
image:images/sample-app-page.png[,800]

8. Go back to topology page. Update OpenLibertyApplication instance to use newer sample image. Click 3 dots beside `OLA knative-enabled-sample`, then `Edit OpenLibertyApplication`.
+
image:images/ola.png[,500]
+
Edit `applicationImage` field under `spec` field:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started@sha256:f7c7da21059eef8734cf0d43a417609aecf68bfe89d0be8e61012fade5877a01
----

9. When you go back to topology page, you will now see 2 revisions and 2 pods in the list. The updated application image information is held in the second revision. This enables point-in-time snapshot of the Knative service, so that all revisions are stored and accessible when needed.
+
image:images/topology-updated.png[,800]

10. Access the sample app on browser again to update the pod. You will see that the version is updated to Open Liberty 23.0.0.8 from 23.0.0.3.
+
image:images/sample-app-page-new.png[,800]

11. Go back to topology page. You will see that the latest revision `knative-enabled-sample-00002` has 100% written on the right side. This indicates 100% of the traffic is routed to `knative-enabled-sample-00002`. Note that the replicas may be 0’s by idle pod.
+
image:images/revisions-new.png[,900]
+
You can rollback to the previous revision, distribute traffic to both revisions and also rollout to the latest revision. Edit the traffic distribution. Click `Set traffic distribution` on the right side of `Revisions` and distribute traffic to both revisions by 50%.
+
image:images/traffic-distribution.png[,500]

12. Access the page through route again. The traffic can be routed to any of the two revisions by 50% chance. Try refreshing the page several times. From time to time, you will see that the version gets changed on the page.
+
image:images/topology-new.png[,900]
+

13. Edit the OpenLibertyApplication instance to disable Knative configuration. Change `createKnativeService` field to false under `spec` field: 
+
Change `createKnativeService: true` under `spec` field to `createKnativeService: false`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  createKnativeService: false
----
+
The operator will delete Knative related resources and create new resources for the application.

14. Select `Details` tab and scroll down to see the status conditions.
+
image:images/status-new.png[,900]
+
Now the OpenLibertyApplication instance is reporting that the application is hosted as a Deployment with static replica of 1. When you check the managed resources in `Topology` section, you will no longer see Knative related resources. You will see that new Deployment, Service and Route resources are created.
