= Horizontal Pod Autoscaler Configuration

This lab focuses on the configuration of Horizontal Pod Autoscaler for OpenLibertyApplication instances.

== Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)
`Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)` is a feature that automates the scaling of workloads such as Deployments or StatefulSets, based on the configured demand for their resources, typically measured by CPU and memory consumption. It dynamically adjusts the number of Pods to efficiently handle the workload's resource requirements. When the workload is under-utilized and the number of running Pods is above the minimum configured value, HPA reduces the number of Pods. Conversely, when the workload is over-utilized and the number of running Pods is below the maximum configured value, HPA increases the number of Pods. By automatically scaling the number of Pods based on demand, HPA enables efficient resource utilization and eliminates the need for manual intervention in scaling decision.

== Configuration Options
Choose one of two methods to deploy OpenLibertyApplication instance on your cluster.

.*Method A: Deployment through `oc` client*
[%collapsible]
====
1. Make sure you have `oc` client installed in your system and are logged into a RedHat OpenShift cluster before you begin the lab.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc login --server=https://<cluster-api-ip-address>:6443 --username=<username> --password=<password>
----
+
For example:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc login --server=https://9.123.456.789:6443 --username=user1 --password=PasswordExample123
----
+
If you do not have access to a cluster, please contact Lab Administrators to have credentials assigned to you.

2. To set your current namespace to be the namespace you will be working in, run the following commands:
+
NOTE: _Replace `<your-namespace>` with the namespace provided to you for the lab._
+
[source,sh]
----
export NAMESPACE=<your-namespace>
oc project $NAMESPACE
----


3. Create a YAML file called `liberty-autoscaling.yaml` with the following content:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: autoscaling-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started
  replicas: 1
  expose: false
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 32Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 32Mi
----

4. Create the OpenLibertyApplication instance using the command:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc apply -f liberty-autoscaling.yaml
----
This will create a Deployment named `autoscaling-liberty-app` with 1 replica. The `resources` field defines a metric source for targeted container resources.

5. Check the status of the OpenLibertyApplication instance by running:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get OpenLibertyApplication autoscaling-liberty-app -ojson | jq '.status.conditions'
----
+
It should print output that the application is `Reconciled`, `Ready` and `ResourcesReady` similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:34:28Z",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Reconciled"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:35:30Z",
    "message": "Application is reconciled and resources are ready.",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Ready"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:35:30Z",
    "message": "Deployment replicas ready: 1/1",
    "reason": "MinimumReplicasAvailable",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ResourcesReady"
  }
]
----
+
As in the example output, `status` field shows the number of running replicas out of configured number of replicas. If the `status` reports that the Application is not ready, check the pod's log.

6. Edit the OpenLibertyApplication instance to use `autoscaling` field as opposed to `replicas` field. Run the command: 
+
[source,sh]
----
oc edit OpenLibertyApplication autoscaling-liberty-app
----
Then remove `replicas: 1` under `spec` field and replace it with the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  autoscaling:
    maxReplicas: 3
    minReplicas: 2
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
----
+
In this example, it  `autoscaling` field configures the range of number of Pods for a workload using `maxReplicas` and `minReplicas`. These fields ensure that the number of Pods falls within the specified range. Replica scaling will be determined using `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` and the metric specified under `resources` field.

7. Check the status of the OpenLibertyApplication instance again by running:
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get OpenLibertyApplication autoscaling-liberty-app -ojson | jq '.status.conditions'
----
It should print output that the application is `Reconciled`, `Ready` and `ResourcesReady` similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:46:34Z",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Reconciled"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:47:34Z",
    "message": "Application is reconciled and resources are ready.",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "Ready"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-24T20:47:34Z",
    "message": "Deployment replicas ready: 2",
    "reason": "MinimumReplicasAvailable",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ResourcesReady"
  }
]
----
+
Compared to the last status output, `status` field now outputs the number of running replicas only without the desired number of replicas. It will report the instance as `Ready` when the currently running number of pods is within the range of `maxReplicas` and `minReplicas`. If the `status` reports that the Application is not ready, check the pod's log.

8. When you check the managed resources, you will see that HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource has been created.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get all -l app.kubernetes.io/part-of=autoscaling-liberty-app
----
It will print output similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----

----

9. Check the status of HorizontalPodAutoscaler resource to see if scaling is working as expected.
+
[source,sh]
----
oc get hpa autoscaling-liberty-app -ojson | jq '.status.conditions'
----
+
It will print output similar to the following:
+
[source,log]
----
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-25T13:15:38Z",
    "message": "recommended size matches current size",
    "reason": "ReadyForNewScale",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "AbleToScale"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-25T13:19:09Z",
    "message": "the HPA was able to successfully calculate a replica count from cpu resource utilization (percentage of request)",
    "reason": "ValidMetricFound",
    "status": "True",
    "type": "ScalingActive"
  },
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2023-08-25T13:19:09Z",
    "message": "the desired count is within the acceptable range",
    "reason": "DesiredWithinRange",
    "status": "False",
    "type": "ScalingLimited"
  }
]
----
+
You should see `AbleToScale` and `ScalingActive` type reporting `True` with `ScalingLimited` type reporting `False`. These report that the workload is being scaled with desired resource utilization.

====

.*Method B: Deployment through OpenShift Web Console*
[%collapsible]
====
1. Access your OpenShift web console. Web console's URL starts with https://console-openshift-console. If you encounter Chrome warning and it does not let you proceed, you will have to type `thisisunsafe` and enter.

2. Switch to the Developer perspective, if it is set to the Administrator perspective. Ensure you are on a project/namespace that you were assigned with for the lab.
+
image:images/perspective.png[,300]

3. Click `+Add`. Under `Developer Catalog`, click `Operator Backed`. This page shows the operator catalog on the cluster and enables you to deploy operator managed services.
+
image:images/operator-backed.png[,500]

4. Click OpenLibertyApplication and create an instance.
+
image:images/create-instance.png[,800]

5. Create an OpenLibertyApplication instance through YAML view.
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps.openliberty.io/v1
kind: OpenLibertyApplication
metadata:
  name: autoscaling-liberty-app
spec:
  applicationImage: icr.io/appcafe/open-liberty/samples/getting-started
  replicas: 1
  expose: false
  resources:
    limits:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 32Mi
    requests:
      cpu: 10m
      memory: 32Mi
----
+
This will create a Deployment named `autoscaling-liberty-app` with 1 replica. The `resources` field defines a metric source for targeted container resources.

6. You will see that an instance is created in `Topology` tab. Click `OLA autoscaling-liberty-app` to see its resources. You can select a resource that you would like to investigate.
+
image:images/topology.png[,900]

7. Check the instanceâ€™s status. Click Search tab on the left and search for OpenLibertyApplications resource. Select `autoscaling-liberty-app`.
+
image:images/ola.png[,900]
+
At the bottom, you will see *Conditions* section, which gives you detail on status conditions of the managed resources and the application instance.
+
image:images/status.png[,900]
+
As in the example, `ResourcesReady` type shows the number of running replicas out of configured number of replicas. If it reports that the application deployment is not ready, check the pod's log.

8. To edit, go back to the top of the page and click YAML tab below the instance name.
+
image:images/edit-yaml.png[,500]
+
Edit the OpenLibertyApplication instance to use autoscaling feature by configuring `autoscaling` field under `spec` field as the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
  autoscaling:
    maxReplicas: 3
    minReplicas: 2
    targetCPUUtilizationPercentage: 50
----
+
In this example, it  `autoscaling` field configures the range of number of Pods for a workload using `maxReplicas` and `minReplicas`. These fields ensure that the number of Pods falls within the specified range. Replica scaling will be determined using `targetCPUUtilizationPercentage` and the metric specified under `resources` field.

9. Check the instanceâ€™s status again. Click Search tab on the left and search for OpenLibertyApplications resource. Select `autoscaling-liberty-app`.
+
image:images/status-new.png[,900]
+
Compared to the last status output, `ResourcesReady` type now outputs the number of running replicas only without the desired number of replicas. It will report the instance as `ResourcesReady` is true when the currently running number of pods is within the range of `maxReplicas` and `minReplicas`. If any type under `Conditions` section reports that the Application is not ready, check the pod's log.

10. To see the changes in effect, check the managed resources in `Topology` section, you will now see a new resource under `HorizontalPodAutoscalers` section.
+
image:images/topology-new.png[,900]
+
When you click on the HPA resource and scroll down to see the status condition, you should see `AbleToScale` and `ScalingActive` type reporting `True` with `ScalingLimited` type reporting `False`. These report that the workload is being scaled with desired resource utilization.
+
